### TODO (Ale)

- Once finished, make tutorial

- Check if some matrix algebra operation fails with the portfolio VaR/ ES or dynamic corr models

- Check crazy short positions on the functions that use x monetary, in case add a failsafe/ warning

- Take away multiday MC?

- Uniform across all models and py files the params names (z, etc)

- Add NaN checker/ blocker in each function

- Add MC and simulations graphs to the plots?

- consider data check for na for downloading data function

- Check conversion/ different results on different days
