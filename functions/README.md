### TODO (Ale)

- Once finished, make tutorial

- Explain buy and hold strategy (always assumed in our calculations) in the pdf report

- Specify in docstrings that options can be empty list (equity only portfolios) for simulations

- Check pd series vs pd df for univariate VaR models and data download functions (maybe add in the data download function if only a ticker is selected it returns the   pd series with date index so runs automatically with univariate models)

- Add summary stats table with quantiles/ averages etc for summary stats function? Or not?

- Function to obtain a single returns vector for univariate analysis VaR? So from portfolio you can plug in directly the vector of returns to univariate VaR models

- Verify behavior of the functions in py scripts (e.g. plots)

- Finish checking data download and backtesting
