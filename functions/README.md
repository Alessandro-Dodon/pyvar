### TODO (Ale)

- Once finished, make tutorial

- Uniform across all models and py files the params names (z, etc)

- Check log returns vs normal returns on everything

- Use term "filtered historical innovations"/ check it out (shoould be the same as standardized residuals)

- Explain buy and hold strategy (always assumed in our calculations) in the pdf report

- Specify in docstrings that options can be empty list (equity only portfolios) for simulations

- Check pd series vs pd df for univariate VaR models and data download functions (maybe add in the data download function if only a ticker is selected it returns the pd series with date index so runs automatically with univariate models)
