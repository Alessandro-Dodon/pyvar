### TODO (Ale)

- Once finished, make tutorial

- Check Nick's function, it should download also returns, this would make it compatible with my functions also for VaR

- Check if some matrix algebra operation fails with the portfolio VaR/ ES or dynamic corr models

- Check crazy short positions on the functions that use x monetary, in case add a failsafe/ warning

- Some ES/ VaR functions should be merged toghether or not? Review them

- Backtesting for the factor models and simulations?

- Plots for MC and HS? Graphs from tests look weird

- Uniform across all models and py files the params names (z, etc)
