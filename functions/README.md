### TODO (Ale)

- Once finished, make tutorial

- Check if some matrix algebra operation fails with the portfolio VaR/ ES or dynamic corr models

- Check crazy short positions on the functions that use x monetary, in case add a failsafe/ warning

- Some ES/ VaR functions should be merged toghether or not? Review them

- Backtesting for simulations?

- Uniform across all models and py files the params names (z, etc)

- Add NaN checker/ blocker in each function

- Add MC and simulations graphs to the plots?

- Move each ES inside its respective module (cleaner that way)

- EVT is param! put it in param VaR py file (and separate the basic VaR into param and non param)

- consider data check for na for downloading data function
