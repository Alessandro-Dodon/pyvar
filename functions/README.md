### TODO (Ale)

- Check returns vs log returns on everything (and % change returns)

- After those, check the shorting for the functions that receive x positions as inputs... (and shorting on others?)

- For portfolio metrics, is AN VaR the base or is portfolio normal? Should be the first, but double check...

- For displaying the tables with PortfolioVaR add head and tail only, it may be too long otherwise (years of data...)

- Check correlations plots and shorting cases

- Plots (make portfolio plots larger, and ES plot fix the bug when going too long of a period)

- Once finished, make tutorial

- Check Nick's function, it should download also returns, this would make it compatible with my functions also for VaR
