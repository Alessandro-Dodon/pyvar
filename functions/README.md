### TODO (Ale)

- Once finished, make tutorial (show first a portfolio with a diversified index like all world etf, then one with different indexes from around the world, and then long on momentum winners and short on underperforming companies)

- Explain buy and hold strategy (always assumed in our calculations) in the pdf report and in functions where needed

- Verify behavior of the functions in py scripts (e.g. plots)
