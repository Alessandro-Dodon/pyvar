### TODO (Ale)

- Maybe add GARCH based simulations (it is complex)

- In the (volatility and basicVaR) functions, add the possibility to use wealth (W) as input, so it is even more customizable

- Finish meta functions/ callers

- Correlation modeling? Finish debugging so they are compatible with ES and plotting functions.
