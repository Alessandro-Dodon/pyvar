### TODO (Ale)

- Finish check on corr models

- Check returns vs log returns on everything (and % change returns)

- After those, check the shorting for the functions that receive x positions as inputs... (and shorting on others?)

- Portfolio VaR (double check), it is not supposed to be backtested or work with ES (but make sure the logic is ok)

- For displaying the tables with PortfolioVaR add head and tail only, it may be too long otherwise (years of data...)

- Check correlations plots and shorting cases
