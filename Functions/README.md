### TODO (Ale)

- Finish check on corr models

- Check returns vs log returns on everything (and % change returns)

- After those, check the shorting for the functions that receive x positions as inputs... (and shorting on others?)

- For portfolio VaR (double check), ES can be implemented, only (?) parametrically (analytical formula)

- For displaying the tables with PortfolioVaR add head and tail only, it may be too long otherwise (years of data...)

- Check correlations plots and shorting cases
