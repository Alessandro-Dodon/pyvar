### TODO (Ale)

- Maybe add possibility of using z not empirical but drawn from distributions with volatility models

- Maybe add GARCH based simulations (it is complex)

- In the (volatility and basicVaR) functions, add the possibility to use wealth (W) as input, so it is even more customizable

- Continue with EVT? (when Plazzi explains it)

- Maybe meta functions (like for plotting etc)

- Modify plotting functions so that the user may select static versions and not interactive if desired (easier for pdf etc)

- Better styling when printing results for portfolio functions

- Backtesting for AN VaR?

- Correlation modeling? And VEC(1,1)?
