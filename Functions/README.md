### TODO (Ale)

- Maybe add GARCH based simulations (it is complex)

- Correlation modeling? Finish debugging 

- Check returns vs log returns on everything (and % change returns)

- After those, check the shorting for the functions that receive x positions as inputs... (and shorting on others?)

- Portfolio VaR (double check), it is not supposed to be backtested or work with ES (but make sure the logic is ok)

- Eliminate ARCH from volatility models? (it is like GARCH but more imprecise...)
