### TODO (Ale)

- Empirical z is correct for ARCH/ GARCH model, but maybe not for EWMA and MA, so assuming a distribution for those may be better. This could explain the very similar violations rate between models.

- Maybe add possibility of using z not empirical but drawn from distributions with volatility models.

- Maybe add different GARCH models (TGARCH etc)

- Maybe add GARCH based simulations (it is complex)

- In the functions, add the possibility to use wealth (W) as input, so it is even more customizable.

- Continue with portfolio methods/ EVT (when Plazzi explains it)

- Maybe add a function and visualization on the VCV 

- Maybe add a function to download data directly from YF to use the portfolio VaR in an easy way

- Maybe meta functions (like for plotting etc.)
