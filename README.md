### TODO:

- Functions and  rest can be deleted, only leave package

- For the project diary (use github history): contribution of everybody (marco simulations, nick LLM, both documentation and revision, factor models, web scraping, testing, ale volatility, portfolio and EVT basic models)

- For plan: just general intro, we cover equity and make it shorter (about half a page)

- For the latex formulas, make sure notations are consistent 

- For the results: show normal underestimates risk and volatility passes all the tests and is more precise. For the portfolio show the 2 different simulations (HS vs MC)

- For nick's program: use the package not the functions!

- For Ale: make the repo public

- For nick and marco: write the readme and how to download the package (example https://github.com/GianMarcoOddo/pyriskmgmt/tree/main/pyriskmgmt), (just say how to clone and download the package very briefly) see my own git repos for download or clone example

- Put LLM in a close folder close to package
