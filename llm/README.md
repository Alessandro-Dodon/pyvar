# pyvar LLM Module

This folder contains optional tools for integrating **local large language models (LLMs)** with the pyvar package. These tools are not included in the main Python package to keep the installation lightweight. However, integrating pyvar with LLM-based applications is straightforward.

## üîß Main Scripts

The two scripts are:
- `llm_rag.py` ‚Äî enables a local LLM to answer questions about your results using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
- `pdf_reporting.py` ‚Äî generates automated risk management reports from pyvar output.

These scripts are designed to:
- Provide **automated financial reporting**
- Allow **interactive querying of your results** using a local LLM

## üìö Knowledge Base

Since this system runs locally, a supporting knowledge base improves LLM output. We include `knowledge_base.pdf` ‚Äî a short PDF with theoretical clarifications about the risk models used in pyvar. It is used by the RAG pipeline to enhance accuracy and relevance.

## üñ•Ô∏è LLM Backend: LM Studio

These tools require **[LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)**, a desktop app for running local LLMs. This is kept separate from the main pyvar package to simplify installation for most users.

## üöÄ Quick Start

If you want to try out the LLM functionality together with pyvar:

- Check the Python script in the `examples/` folder ‚Äî it shows a full pipeline from risk modeling to local LLM Q&A/reporting.
- For help setting up LM Studio, see the notebook `tutorial_llm.ipynb`.
